// The one test hook (0009-workspaces-console FR-033). A test running inside a real VS Code cannot press the button of a modal dialog or read a
// quick pick, so when VS Code runs this extension in its test mode (ExtensionMode.Test, which VS Code sets only for a host started with an
// extension test path, never for an installed extension) the extension publishes one object, under Symbol.for('workspaces-console.test') on
// globalThis, through which a test
//   - queues the answer to the next decision modal (true gives the modal's one button; anything else refuses it; with nothing queued the
//     modal is refused), and reads what each modal would have shown;
//   - reads what the extension showed (the quick picks' items and the panel's pages and models), in the order shown, and delivers a message to
//     the panel as its page would (a click inside a webview cannot be made by a test);
//   - reads a snapshot of what it holds: the repositories found, the views' entries and the MCP servers it would register.
// Outside test mode the object does not exist and every function here does nothing; the modal is VS Code's own. The hook answers no other
// prompt: quick picks and input boxes are driven by VS Code's own commands in the tests.
