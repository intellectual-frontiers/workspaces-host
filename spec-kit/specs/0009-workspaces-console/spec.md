# Feature Specification: Workspaces Console

**Spec ID:** 0009-workspaces-console
**Status:** Draft

**Input:** The Workspaces Console, the one VS Code
extension that is the secondary interface for every repository's
orchestrator. The command line is the core interface: every command exists
there first and the extension adds nothing a command does not do. The
extension finds each repository's launcher by that repository's own
declaration, asks it for its command list as JSON, and then offers the
commands the way VS Code offers anything: a tree of nouns, commands and
resources, findings in the Problems panel, checks as tasks and tests, the
command palette, quick picks and forms built from each command's typed
arguments, a diff of what a write would change before it is made, a modal
confirmation for anything only a person decides, a status bar item, an output
channel, and the context an AI agent needs. It also registers each
repository's MCP server with VS Code. It re-implements nothing, writes
nothing itself, collects no telemetry and opens no network connection. It
covers the common chores a web console would have covered, without a server.
This spec states what it is, where it lives, how it discovers launchers, what
it does, what it never does, and how it is built. What a repository's command
line owes the extension is the public root's protocol (0043-console-protocol);
the extension is `ws-host`'s, and the providers that plug into it hold no code of it.

## Identity

- **FR-001**: The extension MUST be one extension named "Workspaces
  Console", with the extension id `intellectual-frontiers.workspaces-console`
  and the prefix `workspaces-console.` on every command, view, setting and task
  type it contributes. It MUST serve every provider's command line through the
  same code, so that a person has one extension, not one per repository. It is
  a secondary interface: the command line is the core (0041-command-line
  FR-050), and there is no web interface.
- **FR-002**: The extension's source MUST live in this repository, in
  `console/`, and MUST be public: its code, its documentation and its tests
  MUST hold nothing that is not public, and MUST NOT name another repository
  or that repository's command line. It is released as 0007-releases states.
- **FR-003**: The extension MUST run a repository's commands only by invoking
  that repository's launcher with `--json` (what the panel of FR-042 draws is
  that JSON, never a page the launcher rendered) and MUST NOT re-implement a command, a check, a type's validation or
  a rule: what a resource says, a type accepts and an action does is whatever
  the launcher returns (0041-command-line FR-013, FR-024). A chore that a
  command does not yet do MUST be added to the orchestrator first, by its own
  spec, and only then offered here.

## Discovery

- **FR-004**: A repository MUST be found by its own declaration. A workspace
  folder is a provider when its root holds `.workspaces-host/provider.toml`
  (0008-providers FR-001), whose `launcher` key names an executable file at the
  root. The extension MUST carry no list of launcher names and MUST name no
  provider's command line, because it is not any one command line and the one
  place that knows a repository's launcher is the repository. A person MAY add
  launcher names for a folder that declares none through the setting
  `workspaces-console.launchers`, which MUST be settable only in the person's
  own settings and never in a workspace's, so that no repository can name what
  the extension runs.
- **FR-005**: The extension MUST accept a launcher only when running
  `<launcher> command list --json` returns a document whose schema is a
  `command/list` version it understands (FR-021), and MUST take the
  orchestrator's name, its audience and its commands, nouns, verbs,
  categories, arguments and surfaces from that document. It MUST run no other
  program than a trusted repository's launcher (FR-006).
- **FR-006**: The extension MUST run a repository's launcher only when VS
  Code trusts the workspace and the person has trusted the repository
  (0041-command-line FR-052, FR-061), MUST declare that it does not support
  untrusted workspaces, and MUST say in plain words why nothing appears for a
  repository that is not trusted, with the one action that trusts it, which
  is a decision of the person (FR-015). Reading `.workspaces-host/provider.toml` needs no
  trust (0041-command-line FR-062).
- **FR-007**: The extension MUST treat each workspace folder as its own
  repository, with its own launcher, commands, status and findings, so that a
  window holding several repositories shows each one apart, and two
  repositories whose launchers share a name are told apart by their folders.

## What it offers

- **FR-008**: The extension MUST provide a tree view of nouns, then commands,
  then resources: under each repository, the nouns its `command list`
  declares; under a noun, its commands that the editor surface exposes
  (0041-command-line FR-022) and, where the noun has a `list` command, the
  resources that command returns; under a resource, its links (each named by
  its relation) and its actions (each with its category). Every entry MUST be
  built from a resource the launcher returned, and a resource's action that
  cannot run now MUST be absent or shown disabled with its reason
  (0041-command-line FR-017).
- **FR-009**: The extension MUST show the findings of a `check` in VS Code's
  Problems panel, one diagnostic for each finding that has a location, at its
  file and line (a finding's `file:line`), with its severity, its message and
  the section that reported it as the source, and MUST clear a section's
  diagnostics when that section runs again. A finding with no location MUST be
  shown in the check's result and the output channel and MUST NOT be placed at
  a file it does not name.
- **FR-010**: The extension MUST contribute a task type `workspaces-console` whose
  tasks run a repository's repository-wide commands (`check`, `test`, `fresh`,
  `doctor`) and, for `check`, a section or a suite, so that they appear under
  Run Task and can be bound to a keybinding; and MUST show each `check`
  section in VS Code's Test Explorer as a test, run by `check SECTION --json`,
  with a section that the launcher reports as skipped shown as skipped and
  never as passed (0041-command-line FR-033).
- **FR-011**: Every webview the extension opens (the resource panel, FR-042)
  MUST load local resources only, from the extension's own files, under a
  Content Security Policy with a nonce that allows no remote source and no
  inline script or style but its own, run no script from outside it, follow
  only links that name a command the launcher gave the panel, or a file in the
  clone, and draw nothing but VS Code's theme variables. A command line's
  `--html` rendering remains for terminals and other tools; the extension
  never asks for it and keeps no page path for it.

- **FR-012**: The extension MUST offer, in the command palette, `Workspaces Console:
  Run Command…`, which lists every command that declares the editor surface,
  grouped by repository and noun, each with the command's own id, the title and
  icon its `command list` gives it (0041-command-line FR-064) and its category,
  and the repository-wide commands as their own entries (`Workspaces Console: Run
  Check…`, `Prove Generated Files`, `Run Tests`, `Check Health`, `Show Command
  Line…`, `Get Help…`, `Learn a Topic…`, `Copy Context…`, `Open Page…`, `Find
  Resource…`). It MUST list no command that the editor surface does not expose
  (0041-command-line FR-022).
- **FR-013**: The extension MUST build the input for a command from the
  command's typed arguments: one step for each argument, a quick pick where
  the type enumerates its values or the noun has a `list` command that returns
  them, a text input where it does not, with the type's validation message
  shown on a value the launcher refuses, and a last step that shows the whole
  command line (FR-017) before anything runs. It MUST NOT offer a printed
  command with a placeholder (0041-command-line FR-013, FR-055).
- **FR-014**: Before any command that writes (every category but `read` and
  `check`) runs, the extension MUST run it with `--dry-run --json` and show
  each file the change would touch as a diff in VS Code's diff editor, taken
  from the dry run's resource (0041-command-line FR-015), and MUST run the
  command for real only after the person accepts that diff, in the resource
  panel (FR-042), which shows the change summary (each file, its lines added
  and removed) with Open Diff for each file, Apply and Discard. A command whose
  dry run fails MUST NOT be run for real, and the dry run's error MUST be
  shown.
- **FR-015**: A `decision` command MUST run only after a modal confirmation
  that names the command, the resource and what it changes, shown after its
  dry run (FR-014), and that only a person can give. The extension MUST expose
  no setting, command, keybinding, task or API that runs a `decision` command
  without that confirmation (the one answer a test gives in place of a person is
  FR-033's, which exists only in VS Code's test mode), MUST NOT export an API to other extensions, and
  MUST NOT list a `decision` command in its MCP registration (FR-022;
  0041-command-line FR-023, FR-051).
- **FR-016**: The extension MUST show a status bar item for the active
  workspace folder's repository, giving its orchestrator, its audience and a
  plain-words state taken from `doctor` (well, needs attention, or something
  missing), that opens Home with what needs a person in view when chosen
  (FR-039), and MUST show an
  audience other than the one the person expects as the launcher states it,
  never as the extension decides (0041-command-line FR-040, FR-054).
- **FR-017**: The extension MUST write to an output channel "Workspaces Console", for
  each launcher invocation, the one-line command it ran (as
  0041-command-line FR-055 states it), its exit status and its standard error,
  and each line of a stream as it arrives, so that a person can paste what the
  extension did into a terminal. It MUST write no secret and no file contents,
  and MUST set the environment variable `IF_CONSOLE` to `1` for every
  invocation so that the launcher logs the surface `editor`
  (0041-command-line FR-042).
- **FR-018**: The extension MUST offer `context` for an agent: `Workspaces Console:
  Copy Context` runs `<launcher> context RESOURCE --json` for the resource
  selected in the tree or chosen in a quick pick, and puts the result on the
  clipboard or in an untitled editor, as the person chooses; and `Workspaces Console:
  Get Help` assembles `context` and `doctor`, with secrets removed, into the
  report 0041-command-line FR-057 describes. Neither MUST send anything
  anywhere.
- **FR-019**: What the first design's Chores view listed is Home's (FR-037):
  the repository-wide commands are in the palette and the views, the open
  proposals (`proposal list --status open`, each to be read and then decided or
  left, FR-015), the sections whose last check found something, the generators
  `fresh` reports stale (each with its rewriting command and its dry-run diff,
  FR-014), the toolchain entries `doctor` reports absent (each with its fetch
  command) and a "Get help" group. Home MUST be built from the launcher's own
  resources and MUST add nothing the launcher has no command for (FR-003).
- **FR-020**: The extension MUST show a stream (NDJSON,
  0041-command-line FR-019) as VS Code progress with the stream's own words,
  MUST let a person cancel it, ending the launcher's process, and MUST show
  the final resource as the result.
- **FR-021**: The extension MUST check each document's `schema` against the
  versions it understands (0041-command-line FR-053) and, for one it does not,
  MUST say in plain words that an update is needed and show the action that
  updates the extension, and MUST NOT show a document it cannot read.
- **FR-022**: Where VS Code supports registering an MCP server from an
  extension, the extension MUST register, for each trusted repository whose
  command list includes `mcp serve`, one standard-input-and-output server
  whose command is that repository's launcher with the arguments `mcp serve`
  and whose working directory is the repository's root, labelled with the
  orchestrator's name, and MUST change nothing else about the server: its
  tools, resources and refusals are the launcher's (0041-command-line FR-023,
  FR-027). Where VS Code does not support it, the extension MUST say so in the
  output channel and do nothing else.

## What it never does

- **FR-023**: The extension MUST collect no telemetry and MUST open no network
  connection of its own: it MUST NOT use VS Code's telemetry API, make an HTTP
  or socket request, load a remote resource into a webview, call an AI model,
  or send a resource, a log line or a finding to any service. The only network
  traffic in a session is what a launcher itself makes when a command needs it.
- **FR-024**: The extension's settings MUST be only: `workspaces-console.launchers`
  (FR-004); as an option a person turns on, `workspaces-console.checkOnSave`, which
  runs `check --changed --json` for the saved file's repository and shows the
  findings as FR-009 states; `workspaces-console.showAllCommands`, which shows the view
  of every command (FR-036); and `workspaces-console.rowLimit`, the most rows of one
  kind a view lists. Each MUST have the scope `application` and a
  `markdownDescription` (FR-040), and none MAY change what a command does. The
  extension writes none of them (FR-026): the view-title toggle of the view of
  every command lasts for the session.
- **FR-025**: The extension MUST say everything it says to a person in plain
  language, the first line of a resource's text rendering being the label
  where one is needed (0041-command-line FR-054); MUST use VS Code's theme
  colors and icons and no colors of its own; and MUST make each view, action
  and form reachable by keyboard and labelled for a screen reader.
- **FR-026**: The extension MUST write nothing itself: no file in a clone, no
  ignore rule, nothing in `.vscode/`, and no record of its own beyond VS Code's
  own state for the last selection in its views (0041-command-line FR-063).
  Every change to a repository is a launcher command's, made through FR-014 or
  FR-015.

## How it is built

- **FR-027**: The extension MUST be built by `ws-host release build`
  (0007-releases FR-005) from `console/`, with the Node of this repository's
  pinned toolchain and no program from the host, and with its own
  `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, every package pinned to one exact
  version with its integrity hash, installed only from the lock. It MUST have
  no runtime npm dependency: what ships is its own code, and the packages in
  the lock are build and test tools only. The build MUST produce one `.vsix`
  among the release's files.
- **FR-028**: The extension MUST carry tests, written in TypeScript like the
  code (FR-035) and run under Node's built-in test runner with a stand-in for
  the VS Code API and a fake launcher that replays recorded resources,
  covering discovery (FR-004 through FR-007), every feature of FR-008 through
  FR-022 and FR-031, the refusals of FR-015, and the absence of network and
  telemetry calls (FR-023), and `ws-host test` MUST run them, with a test that
  loads the bundle of FR-035 under the stand-in and activates it, and the type
  check and lint of FR-035. The stand-in shows that the code does what the
  tests expect of VS Code; FR-032's tests show that VS Code does what the code
  expects.
- **FR-029**: A person installs the extension from the release's `.vsix`
  (0007-releases FR-013), with `ws-host vscode ensure` or VS Code's own
  `--install-extension` or Install from VSIX command. Publishing the package to
  a marketplace is outside this repository and a decision for a person; no
  command of this repository does it.
- **FR-030**: The extension MUST state the VS Code version it needs in its
  manifest, and MUST keep working, with the features that need a newer VS Code
  absent and said to be, on the oldest version it states (FR-022).

## Learning

- **FR-031**: The extension MUST offer `Workspaces Console: Learn`, a quick pick of the
  topics that the repository's `help` command lists (0041-command-line FR-065),
  each with a codicon and its summary, from each repository whose command list
  has `help`, grouped by repository when a window holds several; and MUST show
  the topic chosen in the resource panel as FR-043 states. A topic is a
  resource of kind `help` whose data has `topic`, `summary`, `plain`,
  `sections` (a heading and its words each) and `steps`, and whose actions are
  the steps in order. The extension MUST carry no topic and no step of its own
  (FR-003).

## Tested in a real VS Code

- **FR-032**: The extension MUST also be tested inside a real VS Code, started
  under a display server, with `@vscode/test-electron` from the extension's own
  lock (FR-027), the VS Code build a pinned entry of this repository's
  toolchain, and the tests in `console/test/vscode/`, run by `ws-host check
  console`. They MUST cover: activation in a trusted
  workspace holding this repository and a fixture second command line; the
  three views populated; every command of the manifest registered, with the
  palette entries the manifest lists; a check that produces diagnostics in the
  Problems panel at the finding's file and line; a dry-run write that opens a
  diff and then applies; a decision that shows a modal, answered through FR-033;
  an untrusted workspace in which the extension does not activate and no launcher
  runs; Learn listing the repository's help topics; and the MCP server
  registered where VS Code supports it. A run that cannot start (no VS Code in
  the store, no display server, a library missing) MUST be reported as
  skipped, naming the cause and the command that fixes it.
- **FR-033**: A test in a real VS Code cannot press the button of a modal
  dialog or read a quick pick, so the extension MUST have one test hook and no
  other: when VS Code runs the extension in its test mode
  (`ExtensionMode.Test`, which VS Code sets only for a host started with an
  extension test path, never for an installed extension), the extension MUST
  publish an object under `Symbol.for('workspaces-console.test')` on `globalThis`
  through which a test (a) queues the answer to the next decision modal, where
  `true` gives the modal's one button, anything else refuses it, an answer is
  used once and with none queued the modal is refused; (b) reads what the
  extension showed, in order: each modal's message, detail, whether it was
  modal and its buttons, each quick pick's title and items, and each panel's
  page and the model it drew; (c) delivers a message to the panel as if its
  page had sent it, where the person's click inside a webview cannot be made by
  a test (it runs no action by itself: a dry run's Apply is still the person's
  choice in the test, and a decision still meets its modal); and (d) reads a snapshot, taken on demand and changing nothing, of the
  repositories found, the entries of its views, the badges, the status bar's
  text, the tests of the Test Explorer and the MCP servers it registers. Outside test mode the object MUST NOT exist and the modal MUST be
  VS Code's own. The hook MUST affect no other prompt: quick picks and input
  boxes are driven by VS Code's own commands in the tests, and no source other
  than the hook's own file MAY read the extension mode.

- **FR-034**: A provider that has tests of its own against the extension MUST
  be able to run them in a real VS Code without this repository naming it:
  `ws-host vscode check --suite DIR [--workspace [NAME=]PATH]... [--report FILE]`
  (the extension's runner, `console/test/vscode/run.js`) runs a suite given as
  a directory (an `index.js` that exports `run()`) once, in a trusted workspace
  whose folders are the ones named in `IF_CONSOLE_VSCODE_FOLDERS` (a JSON array
  of `name` and `path`), with the same VS Code, display server and
  `@vscode/test-electron` as FR-032 and none of FR-032's fixtures. The
  extension host is given the extension's directory so that the suite can load
  the extension's own `test/vscode/suite/harness.js` and `support.js` and the
  hook of FR-033. The runner MUST fail on a failed test and MUST report the
  cause as missing, not as passed, where VS Code, the display server or a
  library is missing (FR-032). It names no repository: the suite and the
  folders are paths.

## The redesigned console

The console is redesigned to look and work like the extensions people use most
(a Home view, rows with status icons, hover actions, a testing view, native
diffs), while holding every guarantee it has. These requirements add to the
requirements above and, where they differ from FR-008 (the tree), FR-012 (the
palette), FR-019 (the Chores view), FR-024 (the settings) and the manifest rules
that FR-015 and FR-027 imply, they govern once the register names a check for
them: until then the rows say so, and the extension as built holds. The command
line states what each view and row is through `presentation`
(0041-command-line FR-064), so the extension stays free of any orchestrator's
knowledge (FR-003).

- **FR-035**: The extension MUST be written in TypeScript with the compiler's
  `strict` option, bundled by esbuild into the one file its manifest's `main`
  names, and linted by ESLint, and MUST be built by `ws-host release build` with
  nothing on the host but `ws-host`'s own toolchain: `typescript`, `esbuild`,
  `eslint`, `typescript-eslint`, `@types/vscode`, `@vscode-elements/elements`,
  `@vscode/codicons`, `@vscode/vsce` and `@vscode/test-electron` come from the
  extension's own npm lock, every one at one exact version with its integrity
  hash. `@types/vscode` MUST be the version of the manifest's `engines.vscode`,
  so that the code cannot use an interface that VS Code lacks. `ws-host release
  build` MUST type-check the code, lint it, bundle it and then pack it, and
  fail on a type error and on a lint error: ESLint runs the recommended rules
  and the type-checked recommended rules of `typescript-eslint`, and a warning
  fails it. The bundle MUST be a production build whose source maps are left
  out of the `.vsix`. The code MUST be in modules that each hold one concern:
  `src/model/` (the typed wire shape, including the presentation of
  0041-command-line FR-064, and the pure logic that reads it), `src/services/`
  (discovery, the launcher with cancellation tokens, a cache of what each
  repository's launcher said about itself that its file watchers empty, trust,
  and a log that is a VS Code log output channel), `src/views/`,
  `src/commands/`, `src/webview/` (its own bundle) and `src/test-mode.ts`
  (FR-033). A use of `any` MUST say why. `ws-host test` MUST also fail where the
  codicon ids that the command line may name (0041-command-line FR-072) are not
  the glyph map of `@vscode/codicons`. The packages are for the build: the
  manifest has no `dependencies`, and the `.vsix` holds the bundle, the media
  and the codicon font, and no `node_modules`, source or source map.
- **FR-036**: The extension MUST contribute one activity-bar container with a
  monochrome icon (an SVG that draws in `currentColor` and no other color), and
  in it, in this order: a Home view (FR-037); one view for each entry of
  `presentation.views` (0041-command-line FR-064) of each repository, in that
  order, holding the nouns whose `view` is its `id`, each noun's resources as
  its `list` describes; a Checks view; and an All commands view, the tree of
  every noun and command (FR-008), which is collapsed and hidden by default. A
  repository whose `command list` has no `presentation` MUST still be served
  by Home, Checks and All commands, which the person can show. A view cannot
  be added while the extension runs, so the manifest holds a fixed pool of
  sixteen view slots after Home, each shown only while a view is planned into
  it and titled when the command lines are read; a view declared by more than
  one command line is one view, its entries grouped by repository, and a noun
  with a `view` but no `list` shows the commands the editor offers for it. A
  noun's rows are read when its group is opened, are listed up to the setting
  `workspaces-console.rowLimit`, and the rest are found by the Find Resource quick
  pick or, where the noun's `list` declares `search`, by the Search action
  (FR-049).
- **FR-037**: The Home view MUST list what needs a person, each as a row with a
  status (FR-038) and an action, from the launcher's own resources: the check
  sections whose last run failed, the open proposals, the generated files
  `fresh` reports stale, the toolchain entries and libraries `doctor` reports
  absent, and the state `doctor` gives, read from the rows and lists that
  `doctor`'s data has (`conflicts`, `missing`, `toolchain` rows whose `cache`
  or `state` is not ready with their `hint` or `fix`, `prerequisites`, the
  system libraries and `state`) and from its actions; a workspace that is not
  trusted is a row too. A row's label is a short sentence in plain words, its
  muted description is the exact command line that fixes it, its tooltip says
  why, its inline buttons run it and copy its command line, and the count of
  rows that need a person is the view's badge. It MUST use `viewsWelcome` content, with
  the one action that fixes it, for: no command line declared; a workspace not
  trusted (FR-006); and a missing toolchain or library. Home MUST add no item
  that the launcher has no command for (FR-003, FR-019).
- **FR-038**: A row of a list MUST show its `label`, its `description` muted
  after it, and a codicon colored by its status (a row with no status shows the
  codicon its list's `icon` field gives, else its noun's), as a `ThemeIcon` with a
  `ThemeColor`, by this fixed mapping of 0041-command-line FR-064's statuses:
  `ok` `pass` with `testing.iconPassed`; `warning` `warning` with
  `list.warningForeground`; `error` `error` with `testing.iconFailed`; `pending`
  `circle-outline` with `testing.iconQueued`; `skipped` `circle-slash` with
  `testing.iconSkipped`; `info` `info` with `notificationsInfoIcon.foreground`;
  `muted` `circle-small-filled` with `disabledForeground`. A row's tooltip MUST
  be a `MarkdownString` with codicons, the row's `tooltip` fields as key facts
  and command links for its actions; what a launcher returned is inserted only
  escaped, and a link carries a handle that the extension issued, so that
  nothing a launcher says can become a link that runs a command; a row's
  `badge` is its decoration's badge. Rows MUST have inline hover actions (the
  `inline` group of `view/item/context`) and context menus in the groups
  `navigation`, `1_run`, `2_copy` and `9_cutcopypaste` in that order; views
  MUST have title actions with icons and a badge of a count where there is one;
  work in progress MUST show as progress in the view that started it
  (`withProgress` at its view id) and be cancellable (FR-020).
- **FR-039**: Every command the extension contributes MUST have the category
  `Workspaces Console`, a title that is a verb and an object (the palette shows "IF
  Console: Show Home"), an icon, and a `when` or `enablement` clause so that
  only the commands that can run now are offered; the commands a launcher
  declares MUST be offered by the title its `command list` gives them
  (0041-command-line FR-064), not one the extension made: the quick pick of
  Run Command shows each command's own title and icon beside its id. The
  extension binds keys for Home, Run Check, Learn and Copy Context, and MUST
  bind none that runs a decision or a write (FR-015). The status bar item MUST
  show an icon, the orchestrator and, when something needs a person, how many
  things (FR-016), a `MarkdownString` tooltip with the audience, the health
  and what needs a person, each with its command line and a button that runs
  it, and open Home with the first suggestion revealed when chosen, never a
  silent refresh.
- **FR-040**: The extension MUST use VS Code's own surfaces before drawing its
  own: the Testing API (a controller with run profiles, a test for each check
  section, and for each reference that a spec or register names whose enforcing
  action is a check, a test item with a range at its line; two run profiles,
  Run and Run with `--changed`; and a child test with a range at the line of
  each finding of a failed section), the Problems panel
  (FR-009), a `FileDecorationProvider` that badges files and their folders that
  have findings, `vscode.diff` for the dry-run diff of a write (FR-014), a
  `LogOutputChannel` for the output channel (FR-017), and settings that each
  carry a `markdownDescription` and the scope `application` (FR-024).
- **FR-041**: For each of `presentation.references` (0041-command-line FR-064)
  the extension MUST provide, in the files it names, a hover that shows the
  resource's `text`, its `facts` and its actions as command links; Go to
  Definition, to the `path` and `line` the resource gives; a CodeLens above the
  reference that shows its `lens` fields with a Run for the resource's `check`
  action, which runs it through the one path every command takes; and a
  document link that opens the resource's page (FR-042). Each
  runs only the launcher's `show` command, only in a trusted workspace, and the
  extension MUST hold no pattern, file name or field of its own for them.
- **FR-042**: A resource MUST open in one panel for the window: a singleton
  webview (opening another resource reveals it and shows that one; it never
  opens a second), with `retainContextWhenHidden` off and its state kept with
  `setState` and `getState` so that it comes back as it was, that loads local
  resources only under a strict Content Security Policy with a nonce (FR-011),
  with history (back and forward), a breadcrumb, and an Open to the Side
  choice. It MUST be drawn from the resource's JSON (the `data`, `links` and
  `actions` of 0041-command-line FR-019), never from a page the launcher
  rendered, with `@vscode-elements/elements` and the codicon font from the
  extension's own files, with VS Code's theme variables only, legible in
  light, dark and high-contrast themes, and usable by keyboard with labels for
  a screen reader. It MUST show:
  - a header with the noun's codicon (from the presentation, FR-036), the
    title, the kind and id, an audience pill (FR-016), status pills in the
    fixed vocabulary's colors (FR-038) and, where the data gives one, when the
    resource was last run;
  - an action toolbar with one primary button, the other actions as icon
    buttons with tooltips and an overflow menu that also has Copy as JSON and
    Copy Context; a `decision` styled apart (a shield icon and the word
    Decision) and still going through the dry run and the modal (FR-014,
    FR-015); an action that cannot run now disabled and saying why;
  - sections chosen by the data's shape: a key-value grid for scalars, a
    sortable, filterable table for a list of objects whose rows that have a
    `show` command open in the panel, a stepper for a list of stages, a list
    of findings grouped by section with a severity icon that opens each at its
    `file:line`, Markdown-safe paragraphs for long text, and links as chips;
    and an empty state with guidance for a section with nothing in it.
- **FR-043**: Learn (FR-031) MUST use the same panel and components as FR-042:
  a topic as numbered steps, each with its words, the exact command line in a
  code block with a Copy button, and a Run button that goes through the one
  path every command takes (FR-013 to FR-015), or, where the launcher does not
  offer the command to the editor or says it cannot run now, a disabled
  button that says why; a step a person must do themselves marked as theirs;
  and a link to the next topic.
- **FR-044**: The extension's manifest and package MUST carry what the
  marketplace shows without being published (FR-029): a 128-pixel PNG `icon`
  that `extension build` makes at build time from the monochrome mark of the
  organization's brand with Pillow (no hand-drawn art, and not tracked), a
  `galleryBanner`, `categories` and `keywords`, a `README.md` that shows the
  screenshots of FR-045 kept small under `console/media/screenshots/`,
  a `CHANGELOG.md`, `package.nls.json` for the manifest's strings, and every
  user-facing string of the code through `vscode.l10n`, with the bundle of
  those strings written at build time. A view of the manifest's pool that no
  command line declares MUST NOT be shown or offered in the palette.
- **FR-045**: The extension's screenshot suite (`console/test/vscode/suite/screenshots.js`,
  run by the runner of FR-034 with `IF_CONSOLE_SCREENSHOTS=DIR`) MUST run the
  extension in a real VS Code under the display server of FR-032, once for each
  of VS Code's `Default Dark+`, `Default Light+` and `Default High Contrast`
  themes, open each view, the command palette, a resource page, Learn, the
  command line a form ends with, the changes of a dry run in the panel and its
  diff, a resource with a table, one with a stage ladder, a check's findings, a
  decision, and the Problems panel, and write a PNG of the whole window of each
  as `DIR/<theme>-<what>.png`, with `dark`, `light` and `high-contrast` as the
  themes. The capture MUST read the display server's own screen dump and need
  no program beyond it and Node. A view that cannot be opened MUST fail the
  run, so that a screenshot is never missing without notice. The files are for
  a person to review and are not tracked.
- **FR-046**: The redesign MUST keep every guarantee of FR-004 to FR-007, FR-014
  to FR-017, FR-022, FR-023, FR-026 and FR-033: trust gating by VS Code's own
  trust, a dry run before a write, a decision only behind a modal and never
  over MCP, no network and no telemetry, MCP registration, discovery by
  `.workspaces-host/provider.toml` and the test hook, and every test of FR-028 and FR-032 MUST
  pass against it, ported to the new code.

- **FR-051**: A person MUST NOT be left in front of an error to work out. When a command line does not start because `ws-host` has not been
  enabled for its repository (its launcher says so: exit status 3 and `ws-host provider add`), Home MUST say so in plain words, show what the launcher
  itself said in the Output, and offer one button, *Enable this repository*. The button asks in a dialog, then opens a terminal with `ws-host provider add`
  typed in, where `ws-host` asks for the final yes. The extension starts no program of its own for it (FR-003).
- **FR-052**: `vscode ensure` MUST leave every provider in use (0008-providers FR-010) ready, so the Console opens with nothing missing: it MUST
  install every program the provider pins, one at a time with each one's progress shown, and the shared libraries they link (asking for the person's
  password, or saying the one command to run when nobody can answer). A clone that declares itself a provider and is not in use MUST be enabled only by
  the person's own typed yes at a terminal, never answered for them and never over MCP; without a person it MUST be left alone with the one command to run.
  `WS_HOST_PROVIDERS=no` opts out.

- **FR-053**: The extension MUST show a Services view, second after Home and shown only where a command line declares a service
  (0041-command-line FR-074): each service as a row with whether it is running (stopped, starting, building, running or failed), where it answers and the
  buttons that matter, Start, Open in Browser and Stop, the row itself doing the obvious one. Start MUST run the service's `command` through the command line's
  own launcher with `--json` and treat its first line's `data.url` as the moment it is running, offering Open in Browser at once; when the command ends before it is up
  the extension MUST run its `prepare` command once and start it again, and say in plain words why when that also fails. Open in Browser MUST use VS Code's own
  address mapping, so it works from a window in WSL or a container. A running service MUST show in the status bar, and the extension MUST end every service it started when
  the window closes. The extension starts no program of its own for this (FR-003).

- **FR-054**: Several programs a command line reports as not installed yet MUST be one Home row with one button, *Install everything* (which runs the
  workspace setup of the command line that offers it, with its progress), and not a column of warnings; one program alone keeps its own row.
- **FR-055**: The extension MUST contribute a getting-started walkthrough for a newcomer: sign in to GitHub, install everything, add a repository, check that it
  works, see the website on this computer, and keep everything current, each step one button that runs a command the extension contributes (*Sign In to GitHub*,
  *Set Up Everything*, *Add Repository…*, *Check Environment*, *Start Service*, *Update Everything*) through the command line that offers it, so that nobody needs
  a terminal or has to know a command line exists. VS Code opens a new extension's walkthrough by itself, so the extension stores nothing to do it (FR-026).

- **FR-056**: When a command streams a sign-in code (a document of kind `auth-code` with `data.code` and an `https` `data.url`), the extension MUST put the code on
  the clipboard, open the address through VS Code, and say in one notice to type the code there and paste it, with a button that opens the page again. Any other
  address MUST open nothing.
- **FR-057**: *Add Repository…* MUST ask for the repository's address, refuse in the box one that is not `host/organization/repository`, run the command line's
  `repo add` for it, and add every repository that arrived to the open window, so that its command line shows with no reload. Home's words for an untrusted window,
  a window with nothing set up and a command line that has not started MUST say in plain words what VS Code is asking or what is missing, and each MUST carry the
  button that fixes it (*Trust this workspace*, *Open Getting Started*, *Install everything*).

## Out of scope

- The commands a repository's orchestrator has: each orchestrator's spec states
  them (0042-agora is the public root's).
- The orchestrators' own rules (0041-command-line) and their MCP servers'
  protocol handling (0041-command-line FR-027).
- Editors other than VS Code, and a web interface.
- Publishing the extension to a marketplace (FR-029).

## Edge cases

- A repository that holds a launcher but no `.workspaces-host/provider.toml`: it is not
  found, and a person who wants it adds its name in their own settings, per
  FR-004.
- A repository whose `.workspaces-host/provider.toml` names a launcher that does not answer
  `command list` with a document the extension understands: it is not shown as
  an orchestrator and the output channel says why, per FR-005 and FR-021.
- A repository's file that tries to name what the extension runs, other than
  its own launcher: ignored, because only the person's own settings add names,
  per FR-004.
- VS Code in Restricted Mode, or a repository the person has not trusted:
  nothing is run and the reason is shown in plain words with the action that
  trusts it, per FR-006.
- A window with two repositories whose launchers have the same name: each
  appears under its own folder, per FR-007.
- A `check` finding with no file: it is shown in the result and the output
  channel and not as a diagnostic, per FR-009.
- A check section that was skipped: it is shown as skipped, not passed, per
  FR-010.
- A command with a typed argument whose value the launcher refuses: the step
  shows the type's message and examples, and nothing runs, per FR-013.
- A write whose dry run fails: nothing is written and the error is shown, per
  FR-014.
- An AI agent working inside the editor asks the extension to accept a spec's
  status change: no command, setting or API of the extension does it, and the
  confirmation is modal, per FR-015.
- A person copies the command line shown in the last step of a form: it is one
  line with no placeholder and runs the same in a terminal, per FR-013 and
  FR-017.
- A stream the person cancels: the launcher's process ends and the output
  channel says so, per FR-020.
- A document with a schema newer than the extension knows: an update is
  offered and nothing unreadable is shown, per FR-021.
- A VS Code without MCP registration support: the output channel says so and
  nothing else changes, per FR-022.
- A launcher that needs the network for a command: that traffic is the
  launcher's; the extension itself opens none, per FR-023.
- A host with no Node installed: the extension is still built, with Node from
  the locked wheel, per FR-027.
- Another extension asks this one for its API: it exports none, per FR-015.
- A launcher whose `command list` has no `presentation`: Home, Checks and All
  commands serve it with plain rows, and nothing is invented for it, per FR-036.
- A high-contrast theme: the panel and the rows use theme variables and colors
  only, so they stay legible, per FR-042.
- A view that cannot be opened in the screenshots run: the run fails and names
  it, per FR-045.
- A decision modal in a test: answered through the test hook, which exists only
  in test mode; an installed extension has none, per FR-033.
- A real VS Code run on a host with no display server: skipped with the cause
  and `ws-host system ensure`, per FR-032.

## Assumptions

- A person who uses the extension works in VS Code and has the repository's
  launcher's own host prerequisite, `ws-host`
  (0025-tooling-environment FR-014).
- Each orchestrator answers `command list --json` and returns the dry-run
  change of a write as a diff per file (0041-command-line FR-015), and sets its
  log surface from `IF_CONSOLE` (0041-command-line FR-042).
- A person trusts a repository deliberately, and trust in VS Code and in the
  repository are two separate acts (FR-006).

## Open questions

- **OQ-1**: How the extension gets the choices for an argument type with many
  values (a requirement among several thousand): by the noun's `list` command
  and a filter, or by a completion resource that 0041-command-line states.
  Until then the extension uses the noun's `list` command (FR-013).
- **OQ-2**: Answered by FR-032. VS Code is a toolchain entry with the vendor's
  checksum; the display server is `Xvfb`, which has no download and is
  installed with VS Code's libraries by `ws-host system ensure`
  (0008-providers FR-016), so the host still needs only `ws-host` and one
  documented `sudo` setup.
- **OQ-3**: Whether a file open in the editor maps to a resource for `Copy
  Context` through a `file` resource kind each orchestrator declares, or the
  person always chooses the resource (FR-018).

## Key entities

- **Workspaces Console** — the one VS Code extension, id `workspaces-console`, that is the
  secondary interface for every orchestrator.
- **A launcher declaration** — `.workspaces-host/provider.toml` at a repository's
  root, naming its launcher (FR-004).
- **A repository's view** — one workspace folder's launcher, commands, status
  and findings (FR-007).
- **A dry-run preview** — the diff of what a write would change, shown before
  it is made (FR-014).
- **A modal confirmation** — what a `decision` command needs and only a person
  can give (FR-015).
- **Learn** — the quick pick of a repository's help topics, each shown as a
  resource with its steps as buttons (FR-031).
- **Presentation** — what a command line says about how its nouns are listed
  and titled, in `command list` (FR-036, FR-038; 0041-command-line FR-064).
- **Home** — the first view, what needs a person (FR-037).
- **The resource panel** — the one webview in which a resource, a Learn topic
  and a dry run's changes open (FR-014, FR-042, FR-043).
- **The test hook** — the one object, present only in VS Code's test mode,
  through which a test answers a decision's modal (FR-033).
- **The Chores view** — the repository-wide commands and what needs a person,
  from the launcher's own resources (FR-019).

## Success criteria

- **SC-001**: A person opens a trusted repository in VS Code and sees its
  orchestrator, its audience and its health in the status bar, and its nouns
  and commands in the tree, without configuring anything but the repository's
  own declaration.
- **SC-002**: Every command the editor surface exposes can be run from the
  command palette with its arguments chosen from the types' own choices, and
  none that only a person decides runs without a modal confirmation.
- **SC-003**: Every write is shown as a diff before it is made.
- **SC-004**: The extension makes no network connection and sends no
  telemetry.
- **SC-005**: The extension is built with no program from the host and ships
  no runtime npm dependency.
- **SC-006**: A person learns the daily work from Learn without reading the
  guide, and the extension's behavior is shown in a real VS Code, not only in
  a stand-in for its API.

- **SC-007**: A person who opens a trusted repository sees Home first, with
  what needs them, then the views its command line declares, and reviews each in
  light, dark and high-contrast screenshots before it ships (FR-036, FR-045).

- **FR-047**: Retired. The extension is built from this repository only (FR-027), and no other repository loads its modules.

- **FR-048**: Every suggestion the extension shows, in Home, the status bar, a
  notification, a welcome view or the results of a check, MUST be actionable:
  it MUST say what is wrong in plain words, give the exact command line that
  fixes it (one that can be pasted in a terminal, 0041-command-line FR-055) and
  a button that runs it through the one path every command takes (FR-013 to
  FR-015), or, where no command does, say what the person must do themselves.
  It MUST NOT point at "below", "above" or "a suggestion" that the person
  cannot see. A message about a result that needs a person MUST have a button
  that runs the first fix, named for it, and a "Show all" button that opens
  Home with that suggestion revealed. A command line gives every suggestion an
  action (0041-command-line FR-017), so that there is a command to run; where
  one gives none, the suggestion says what the person does.

- **FR-049**: Where a noun's `list` declares `search` (0041-command-line
  FR-064), the view that holds it MUST have a title action Search, in the
  `navigation` group beside Find Resource, that asks for text in an input box
  and runs the `list` command with that option and the text, never by a name
  of its own, and shows the rows it returns, in the order the command line
  gave them (which is its ranking), in a quick pick of each row's icon, label,
  description and tooltip facts, from which a choice opens the resource in the
  panel; the Find Resource quick pick MUST remain for the rows already loaded.
  The panel MUST draw a resource's header with the codicon its noun's `list`
  `icon` field gives for that resource where its data has the field, and MUST
  make a table cell a link when the cell's text is the first value of a `show`
  link the document gives and the row opens another resource, so that a
  statement's object and a table's other terms open the resource they name.
  Where a command line's `list` declares `search`, a request that finds nothing
  MUST say so in words and offer the unfiltered list.
- **FR-050**: Retired. The extensions a repository recommends in `.vscode/extensions.json` are that repository's own choice (0042-agora FR-038 in the public root, which vets the ones it recommends).
